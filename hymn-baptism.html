  <h3>BAPTISM</h3>
  <section>
    <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
    <p>Jesus came to John the Baptist,<br />
      In Judea long ago,<br />
      And was baptized by immersion<br />
      In the River Jordan’s flow.
    </p>
    <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
    <p>
    “To fulfill the law,” said Jesus,<br />
    When the Baptist questioned why,<br />
    “And to enter with my Father<br />
    In the kingdom up on high.”
    </p>
    <h2>[Verse 3]</h2>
    <p>
    Now we know that we must also<br />
    Witness faith in Jesus’ word,<br />
    Be baptized to show obedience,<br />
    As was Jesus Christ, our Lord.
